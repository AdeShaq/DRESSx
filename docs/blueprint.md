## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6) to evoke trust and sophistication in the tech.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) to keep focus on clothing items, given the app's fashion context. Dark mode can use a dark equivalent.
- Accent color: Warm orange (#FFAB40) to draw attention to interactive elements like 'Make Outfit.'
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for its modern, neutral look and great legibility on various screen sizes.
- Use a consistent style for all icons (e.g., outline style) to maintain a clean and modern look.
- Use subtle transitions and animations (e.g., fade-in effects, progress indicators) to enhance user experience.
